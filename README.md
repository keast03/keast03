- 👋 Hi, I’m @keast03

I am Kevin, and I am new to the coding world. I know embarrasingly little, but I am working through the psets in the cs50 course as I orient myself to the 
concepts in programming / coding. I am hoping that coding will not only give me opportunities for career development, but also the ability to solve some problems
in my life and for friends around me for the years to come.

- 👀 I’m interested in ...
I have been a fitness buff since I was much younger (I am 36 right now), avid reader, and generally all about consistency, coding is hard, 
but I am understanding it is one of those trust the process endeavors that you just need to stay consistent with eventhough some days it feels
like nothing is going your way. I lived in Beijing, China 7 years, and currently living in North Africa, (Tunisia).

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
As I mentioned above, I am currently learning C through Harvards cs50 course, and going through it painfully slow, not sure if I am too old or what,
but at this point, I just need to stick with it and get 1% better everyday.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
I would love to collaborate on something, but im afraid I am so new to the game that I wouldn't be much use, but if anyone is working on the psets in the cs50 course,
it would be incredibly motivating to go through it with someone together.

- 📫 How to reach me ...
If anything written here piques your interest, feel free to mssg me through instagram @k.east03 or @eastrnfit. Happy coding!
